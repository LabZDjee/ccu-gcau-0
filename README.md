For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

Further note: about the security issue in **webpack-dev-server** (_CVE-2018-14732_), we have to live with it as upgrading from `^2` to `^3.1.11` as it is recommended breaks `npm init` for this Vue CLI 2 based application
